# Product Lookup Discord Bot

This is a Discord bot I built to fetch and display product information from the [Platzi Fake Store API](https://fakeapi.platzi.com/). The bot is designed to make it easy (and kind of fun!) for users to search for products and view their details directly in Discord using simple commands.

## What the Bot Can Do

With just a few commands, users can:

- `!find <name or id>` – Search for any product by name or ID and get its full details.
- `!category` – See a list of available categories and react with emojis to explore products in each one.
- `!find random` – Not sure what you want? Get a random product surprise!

## What You'll See for Each Product

Whenever a product is displayed, the bot shows:

- **Product Name**
- **Description**
- **Price**
- **Category**
- **Image**

All fetched live from the Platzi Fake Store API and formatted for easy viewing in Discord.
